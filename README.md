# Recipe Drawer

This is a simple app that allows you to digitize your personal recipe collection. The OCR is capable of reading text from pictures taken from smartphones or pdf images. 
The higher the quality image, the more accurate the OCR is able to read text. In this app a user will also be able to orginize their collection into sub categories called "books".

### Uploading a new Recipe
To create a new recipe the user can either enter a recipe from scratch or use a picture stored on their computer.
Once the user has chosen a picture, either from their computer or one they have taken themselves, they simply need to follow the 
prompts to populate the recipe form with the text that was ripped from the image.
